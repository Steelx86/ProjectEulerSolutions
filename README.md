# My project Euler Solutions!

## These are the solutions to my project Euler problems!
---

I use Ocaml and Python to solve the problems ( with some others on occasion )

Sorry If I skipped some of the problems. Some of the ealier ones can just be solved with a list comprehension in python

## personal rules!
---

- I have to use just standard vim
- No external answers (unless the originals are lost)
- all answers must be given in under a minute
